## [Project 1](https://github.com/Rikenunes8/feup-ia-tp/tree/master/TP1) - Search Problem | Unequal Length Mazes

**Grade:** 20.0

The Unequal Length Mazes game consists of a board of arbitrary dimensions with some of its cells blocked (obstacles). The object of the game is to find a path from the lower left cell to the upper right cell that passes through all available (unblocked) cells just once. The path must alternate between horizontal and vertical segments, and two consecutive segments cannot be the same size.

## [Project 2](https://github.com/Rikenunes8/feup-ia-tp/tree/master/TP2) - Supervised Learning Problem | Student's Dropout and Academic Success

**Grade:** 19.0

The main focus of this problem is to analyze the known information about student enrollment (academic background, demographics and socio-economic factors) and the academic performance of students at the end of the first and second semesters with the aim of using this data to build ranking models to predict student dropout and academic success.
